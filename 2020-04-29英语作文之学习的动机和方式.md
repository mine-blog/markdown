## 学习的动机和方式


Nowadays,more and more people start their way to promote their knowledge condition,but what confuses us is that most of them consider learning as a method to make money.In this way,they miss their original intention.At last,they spend much time in vain.

From my point of view,a pure motivation in learning plays an significant part in our success.For instance,if you learn just for raising your salary while others spare no effort to upgrate individual ability,in the end,you probably regretly find your friends make their breakthroughs,but you fail to catch up with your goals.Also,we need the favorable methods to finish our targets.

If you would like to compete with others in your major field,a suitable method can help you reach where you dream for.For example,when you have planned to recite a text while you didn't know what the passage tells,it must be a dull and ineffective process.To put it in another word,before you spend time beginning your project,make sure you have a good understading of it.

Sucess won't happen to everyone but if you have a pure motivation and methods in learning, eventually you will find you have already conquered the peak.
