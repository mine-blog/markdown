## my opinions on online course

In this term,due to virus' influence,we all have to stay home and learn with computer which our teachers try their best to show us lessons.If we students all have firm will,we don't need to doubt whether the method is inefficient,while as for me,sometimes I question that I didne't learn enough as much as in shool.

For my learn at home,I usually forget to finish my homework.Moreover,I even forget to when to start my class.So I would think it couldn't be only one,there must be someone or some others like me.During a month,I have changed my mind,to support our country to defeat virus,we everyone should contribute his power.Our teachers manage to take messures to impart knowledge to us,we don't have interface to refuse to do our best to conquer the problems.

No matter how difficult it is,even we have some conplain,we should appreciate our teachers' work.If not their tireless efforts,we have to stay home and live with TV and waste our youth.
